# ChatifyGmail
An app which keeps track of mails from registered email addresses (referred to as contacts). The app lets you add mail contacts and then notifies whenever you get an new mail from only those contacts you have added. Cool right! So start using Chatify, never let an important mail get lost in the clutter.
